## Controlled mode (`forcePage`)

When `forcePage` is provided, the component should be absolutely controlled.

It should not be possible to let user clicks change the page (without the controlled state changing from the listening parent component).

- Detail several props:
  - theme
  - callbacks like onClick
  - explain controlled `page`
  - etc.
